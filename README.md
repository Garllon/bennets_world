Couchmentoring: EVERYONE can learn to code
================

# Prerequisites

I use Gosu for this testproject.

So you need the SDL 2 library. Gosu is built on top of the SDL 2 library.

For Mac use:
```
brew install sdl2
```

For Linux use:
```
apt-get install libsdl2-dev
```

Then install gosu:
```
gem install gosu
```

# Description

This is a project for my Couchmentoring.

```
bundle exec ruby bennets_world.rb
```
